        "To find the best threshold, we used a policy iteration algorithm to find the maximal reward rate for a given foraging environment. The foraging environment was defined by the following parameters from our experiments; the harvest time (2 seconds), travel time (8.33 seconds), the distribution of initial rewards to a tree (N(15, 1)) distribution of the decay function (beta distribution,(alpha=14.90873, beta=2.033008). We assumed the agent knew the mean depletion rate (0.88 multiplied by the previous reward) and used this value to predict the expected reward on the current trial. If the predicted reward ```Er``` was less than or equal to the agent’s threshold ```thresh``` it exited the patch, otherwise it harvested the patch which yielded reward.\n",

The cost of travel in high effort blocks (```beta_s[which_S, 3]``` and ```beta_s[which_S, 5]```) was expressed as the marginal increase in cost of travel (```beta_s[which_S, 2]+beta_s[which_S, 3]``` and ```beta_s[which_S, 4]+beta_s[which_S, 5]```) from low to high effort. Defining this cost as a difference measure controls for any additional biases individual participants may have which are common to both conditions (i.e., consistently high exit thresholds for some participants and low thresholds for others). The conditions are (```is_Matching, is_Mismatching, is_small, is_large```). The parameters of greatest interest are cognitive effort cost ```beta_s[which_S, 3]``` and physical effort cost ```beta_s[which_S, 5]```."
